# CS-GO-Round-Winner-Prediction
In this project, we are focused on predicting the winners of rounds in the popular video game Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO). By utilizing data and machine learning techniques, we aim to develop a predictive model that can anticipate the outcome of rounds within the game.
This model can provide valuable insights for players and teams, helping them make informed decisions and strategize effectively in CS:GO matches.
